|---------|--------------------------------------------|-------------
| SMA0010 | TSelf is Not Self                          | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself.
| SMA0011 | TSelf is Not Self or Base                  | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself or its base type.
| SMA0012 | TSelf is Not Self or Derived               | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself or its derived type.
||
| SMA0015 | TSelf Constraint is Not Self               | `TSelf` type constraint is not pointing itself.
