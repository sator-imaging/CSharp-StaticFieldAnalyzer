| SMA0001 | Reading Uninitialized Value                | Static field declaration order is wrong.
| SMA0002 | Cross Referencing across Type              | Trying to read value from static field declared in cross-referencing type.
| SMA0003 | Static Member Declared in Another File     | Initialization order of partial type files is undefined in language spec.

|---------|--------------------------------------------|-------------
| SMA0010 | TSelf is Not Self                          | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself.
| SMA0011 | TSelf is Not Self or Base                  | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself or its base type.
| SMA0012 | TSelf is Not Self or Derived               | `TSelf` type arg should be pointing itself or its derived type.
||
| SMA0015 | TSelf Constraint is Not Self               | `TSelf` type constraint is not pointing itself.
